# Air-Traffic-Control-Radar-System-Simulation
This project simulates an Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar system, visualizing the positions of aircraft in a defined airspace. It includes their speed, heading, altitude, and detects potential collisions. The system aims to help air traffic controllers manage air traffic, optimize airspace usage, and serve as a training tool for future controllers.
Air Traffic Control Radar System Simulation
Overview
This project simulates an Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar system, visualizing the positions of aircraft in a defined airspace. It includes their speed, heading, altitude, and detects potential collisions. The system aims to help air traffic controllers manage air traffic, optimize airspace usage, and serve as a training tool for future controllers.

Features
Real-Time Aircraft Position Tracking: Visualizes the aircraft's positions on a radar plot, updating in real-time.
Collision Detection: Detects potential collisions based on the proximity of aircraft within the radar system.
Airspace Zone Management: Defines and visualizes multiple airspace zones for better traffic control.
Radar Coverage: Simulates radar coverage and tracks aircraft that are within the radar's effective range.
3D-like Visualization: Displays aircraft altitude on a 2D radar screen for a pseudo-3D effect.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
matplotlib: For creating radar plots and visualizing aircraft positions.
numpy: For numerical calculations (e.g., distance, speed).
random: For generating random positions, speeds, headings.
time: For simulating real-time updates.
Future Extensions (optional):
Machine Learning: Predicts air traffic patterns and optimizes airspace management.
IoT: Real-time aircraft tracking via IoT devices.
Project Components
Aircraft Class
Simulates an aircraft with attributes like position (x, y), speed, heading, altitude, and methods to move, check for collisions, and get its current position.

Radar System Class
Simulates a radar system that tracks aircraft, manages airspace zones, and visualizes all components on the radar plot.

Installation
1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/air-traffic-control-radar.git
cd air-traffic-control-radar
2. Install the necessary libraries:
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, use the following command to install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Running the Simulation:
Run the main.py script to start the simulation:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
The radar system will visualize aircraft positions, airspace zones, and potential collisions in real-time.

How it Works
Aircraft Generation: Aircraft objects are created with random positions, speeds, headings, and altitudes.

Radar System Setup: The radar system is initialized with a defined radar range and optional airspace zones.

Simulation Loop: In each iteration:

The radar visualizes the current positions of all aircraft.
Aircraft positions are updated based on their speed and heading.
Collision detection is performed for all aircraft within range.
The radar plot is updated to reflect the new positions and zones.
Display: The radar plot is updated with aircraft positions, radar coverage, and airspace zones.
