# Air-Traffic-Control-Radar-System-Simulation
This project simulates an Air Traffic Control (ATC) radar system, visualizing the positions of aircraft in a defined airspace. It includes their speed, heading, altitude, and detects potential collisions. The system aims to help air traffic controllers manage air traffic, optimize airspace usage, and serve as a training tool for future controllers.
