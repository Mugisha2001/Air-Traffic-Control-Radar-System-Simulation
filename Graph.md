1. Radar Plot (Aircraft Positions Over Time)
X-axis: Time (or a simulation step/iteration) — Represents how the aircraft positions change as time progresses. This can also be in real-time or simulated time intervals.
Y-axis: Position (in the 2D plane) — Represents the aircraft's position in the radar system. The aircraft are plotted on this plane based on their x and y coordinates.
Data Points: Each point on the radar plot represents an aircraft's position at a particular moment in time.
Interpretation:
Aircraft Movement: If aircraft points change position over time, it means the aircraft are moving in the airspace based on their speed and heading.
Radar Coverage: Aircraft that appear inside a defined radar range or coverage circle are within the radar's detection area.
Collision Risk: If two or more aircraft positions are very close on the radar plot, it may indicate a risk of collision, which should be further investigated based on the proximity threshold.
2. Altitude vs. Time Graph
X-axis: Time (in seconds or simulation steps).
Y-axis: Altitude (in feet or meters).
Data: The altitude data shows how the altitude of the aircraft varies over time.
Interpretation:
Climb/Descent: If the graph shows a continuous upward trend, it indicates the aircraft is climbing. A downward trend indicates descent.
Stabilized Altitude: A flat or constant line suggests the aircraft has reached a cruising altitude or is maintaining a specific altitude.
Altitude Fluctuations: Significant fluctuations in altitude could indicate irregular flight behavior or a change in flight plan.
Safety Boundaries: The graph may also help visualize if the aircraft is in safe altitude ranges for the given airspace.
3. Speed vs. Time Graph
X-axis: Time (in seconds or simulation steps).
Y-axis: Speed (in knots or meters per second).
Data: Displays the speed of the aircraft over time.
Interpretation:
Speed Variations: A gradual increase or decrease in speed could indicate a change in the aircraft's flight profile, such as accelerating during takeoff or decelerating before landing.
Speed Consistency: A steady speed graph suggests the aircraft is maintaining a constant velocity, which is typical during cruising.
Excessive Speeds: If the speed exceeds predefined safety limits (e.g., exceeding a maximum speed for an airspace), it may trigger alerts for air traffic controllers.
4. Proximity (Collision Detection)
X-axis: Aircraft ID or Time (depending on what you are plotting).
Y-axis: Distance between aircraft (in nautical miles or kilometers).
Data: Distance between the aircraft at each time interval.
Interpretation:
Collision Risk: If the distance between two or more aircraft falls below a certain threshold (e.g., 5 nautical miles), it triggers a potential collision warning.
Risk Level: A continuously decreasing distance between aircraft could suggest an imminent collision or need for course correction.
Alert System: The system should trigger an alert if aircraft get too close to each other, indicating that action (such as altitude change or path adjustment) is needed.
5. Radar Coverage Visualization
X-axis: Aircraft Position (x-coordinate).
Y-axis: Aircraft Position (y-coordinate).
Overlay: Radar coverage zone represented by a circle or defined area on the plot.
Interpretation:
Aircraft Detection: Aircraft within the coverage circle are detected by the radar, while those outside the circle are not.
Radar Limitations: Aircraft outside the radar range may not be tracked accurately, simulating real-world radar limitations.
Airspace Management: Radar coverage should be optimized to ensure all aircraft within a given airspace are being monitored, and the system is ensuring no aircraft are outside this coverage.
Key Points in a Typical Interpretation:
Accuracy: Are the aircraft following expected patterns based on their speed, heading, and altitude?
Anomalies: Any unexpected behaviors like sudden speed or altitude fluctuations that could suggest a problem or error in the system.
Safety: Identifying zones where aircraft are at risk of colliding or entering a restricted airspace.
Efficiency: Optimizing flight paths, reducing congestion, and ensuring smooth traffic flow based on radar data and analysis.
By interpreting these graphs and monitoring aircraft positions, speed, altitude, and proximity, an Air Traffic Controller (ATC) can make informed decisions to manage air traffic safely and efficiently.
